libpam-afs-session (2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED and PAM_REFRESH_CRED handling in
      combination with opening a new session.  Fixes failure to isolate
      tokens when used with sudo.  (Closes: #782589)
  * Remove erroneous branch information from Vcs-Git.
  * Prefer *.tar.xz in debian/watch to match packaging.
  * Add debian/gbp.conf reflecting the branch layout of the default
    packaging repository.
  * Refresh upstream signing key.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.6 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Sep 2015 11:45:52 -0700

libpam-afs-session (2.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove now-unnecessary dh_builddeb override to force xz compression.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.
  * Specify the Debian packaging branch in the Vcs-Git control field.
  * Add the upstream release signing key and verify it in debian/watch.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Apr 2014 12:51:12 -0700

libpam-afs-session (2.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch to add AM_PROG_AR to configure.ac, now apparently
    required by Automake for the binutils in unstable.  (Closes: #713292)
  * Apply upstream patch to build with largefile support.  This is
    probably pointless for this module, but consistency is good.
  * Switch to xz compression for the binary package and *.debian.tar file.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Canonicalize the Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser URLs.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4 (no changes required).

libpam-afs-session (2.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable bindnow hardening flags.
  * Change the architecture of the package to linux-any, since there is no
    OpenAFS support for the FreeBSD kernel yet.
  * Bump debhelper dependency to 9 now that compatibility mode V9 is no
    longer experimental.
  * Regenerate the Autotools build system with dh-autoreconf.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 06 Feb 2012 18:23:17 -0800

libpam-afs-session (2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Reset the SIGCHLD handler while spawning an external aklog program
      so that the application SIGCHLD handler isn't invoked when aklog
      exits.  (Closes: #630609)
  * Convert to multiarch.  Depend on the multiarch version of
    libpam0g, install the module into the multiarch version of
    /lib/security, and declare the package Multi-Arch: same.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9 (experimental).
    - Build-Depend on debhelper 8.1.3 or later.
    - Add Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}.
    - Add Lintian override for using an experimental debhelper level.
  * Remove unnecessary debian/dirs file.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jul 2011 18:26:10 -0700

libpam-afs-session (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix memory allocation bug in the previous release.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Jun 2011 20:01:40 -0700

libpam-afs-session (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Honor KRB5CCNAME from the general environment if it is set and that
      variable is not set in the PAM environment, rather than declining to
      run aklog.  (Closes: #621496)
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 07 Jun 2011 14:17:00 -0700

libpam-afs-session (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Return PAM_SUCCESS instead of PAM_IGNORE from pam_setcred if AFS is
      not available or if we're deleting credentials but the PAM module is
      configured not to delete tokens.  Returning PAM_IGNORE from
      pam_setcred confuses the Linux PAM library.
    - Fix error return statuses for pam_setcred.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Mar 2011 14:25:51 -0800

libpam-afs-session (2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - The program option can now pass arguments to aklog by separating
      them with spaces, tabs, or commas (commas are most useful in the PAM
      configuration files).
    - Paths to aklog containing spaces or commas are no longer supported.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Jan 2011 15:37:59 -0800

libpam-afs-session (2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - If there is no PAG, create a new one and obtain tokens even if the
      module has already run.  Works around destruction of the PAG on
      Linux by keyring initialization PAM modules.
    - pam_close_session now removes module-specific data indicating that
      the module has already run, for better behavior in the rare case of
      opening multiple sessions using the same PAM handle.
    - Log an ignore status properly when debugging is enabled.
  * Add libtest-pod-perl to build dependencies for documentation tests.
  * Document the Linux kernel requirement for keyring support to use AFS
    PAGs properly in README.Debian.  (Closes: #516864)
  * Document the requirement for vserver guests to have access to the
    /proc file used by the OpenAFS cache manager for AFS system calls in
    README.Debian.  (Closes: #485049)
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.

libpam-afs-session (1.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [3e57d766] Don't return an initialized value when notokens is set
  * Install a pam-auth-update profile for pam_afs_session that runs it
    from the additional section during both auth and session.  Thanks,
    Nate Coraor.  (Closes: #523796)
  * Remove libpam-openafs-session transitional package.  This package was
    needed for upgrades from etch to lenny.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Change section to admin to match override.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).
  * Explicitly declare source format 1.0 for right now.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Aug 2010 17:45:40 -0700

libpam-afs-session (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Return PAM_IGNORE when AFS isn't available and when functions are
      skipped due to the configuration.
    - Set explicit hidden visibility for all local symbols and further
      restrict the visible symbols with a version script, removing leaks
      of symbols into the application namespace.
  * Install NEWS as the upstream changelog.  Upstream no longer includes a
    detailed CHANGES file.
  * Add a Homepage control field.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Jul 2008 22:56:13 -0700

libpam-afs-session (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Correctly check the exit status of aklog.
    - Additional documentation and examples.
  * Install the upstream CHANGES as changelog.gz and install NEWS
    separately.
  * Improve debian/copyright based on upstream's LICENSE file.
  * Touch $@ instead of the named stamp files.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Mar 2008 20:34:00 -0800

libpam-afs-session (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixed several memory leaks.
    - Don't dereference a NULL pointer on memory allocation failure.
  * Copy the PAM module instead of using make install.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Sep 2007 01:05:27 -0700

libpam-afs-session (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommend openafs-client rather than depend on it.  All the module
    truly requires is that the kernel module be loaded, which isn't what
    openafs-client provides.  Users may be using a separately built
    OpenAFS package or Arla.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Jun 2007 18:35:07 -0700

libpam-afs-session (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New afs_cells configuration option to get tokens in other cells.
  * Use DESTDIR in debian/rules now that it's supported.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 10 May 2007 18:10:48 -0700

libpam-afs-session (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Replace libpam-openafs-session with libpam-afs-session.
    - Support refreshing tokens.  (Closes: #318936)
    - Support reading configuration options from krb5.conf.
    - Support many additional options.
    - Add a pam_afs_session man page documenting the available options.
  * Provide a transitional package to ease upgrades.
